## Social Network API - Homework Week 18

## Description

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that can be used as a general purpose document database by storing data in objects. It is popular due to its flexibility with unstructured data and speed with large amounts of data. I was tasked to create a social network API where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list.

This application utilizes Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, the Mongoose Object Document Model (ODM), and moment for timestamp formatting.
